h2(#what-is). %1.% What is Marrow Mailer?

Marrow Mailer is a Python library to ease sending emails from your application.

By using Marrow Mailer you can:

* Easily construct plain text and HTML emails.
* Improve the testability of your e-mail deliveries.
* Use different mail delivery management strategies, e.g. immediate, deferred, or even multi-server.
* Switch the transport, e.g. SMTP or maildir, by just changing some values in a configuration file.
* Multiple simultaneous configurations for more targeted delivery.

Mailer supports Python 2.6+ and 3.1+ and there are no other dependencies on external packages for normal operation [1].

fn1. In order to run the full test suite you need to install "pymta":http://www.schwarz.eu/opensource/projects/pymta/ and its dependencies.


h2(#installation). %2.% Installation

Installing @marrow.mailer@ is easy, just execute the following in a terminal:

<pre><code>pip install marrow.mailer</code></pre>

If you add @marrow.mailer@ to the @install_requires@ argument of the call to @setup()@ in your application's @setup.py@ file, @marrow.mailer@ will be automatically installed and made available when your own application is installed.


h3(#install-dev). %2.1.% Development Version

Development takes place on "GitHub":github in the "marrow.tags":github-project project.  Issue tracking, documentation, and downloads are provided there.

Installing the current development version requires "Git":git, a distributes source code management system.  If you have Git, you can run the following to download and _link_ the development version into your Python runtime:

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/marrow/marrow.mailer.git
(cd marrow.mailer; python setup.py develop)</code></pre>

You can upgrade to the latest version at any time:

<pre><code>(cd marrow.mailer; git pull; python setup.py develop)</code></pre>

If you would like to make changes and contribute them back to the project, fork the GitHub project, make your changes, and submit a pull request.  This process is beyond the scope of this documentation; for more information, see "GitHub's documentation":github-help.

h2(#what-is). %1.% What is Marrow Mailer?

Marrow Mailer is a Python library to ease sending emails from your application.

By using Marrow Mailer you can:

* Easily construct plain text and HTML emails.
* Improve the testability of your e-mail deliveries.
* Use different mail delivery management strategies, e.g. immediate, deferred, or even multi-server.
* Deliver e-mail through a number of alternative transports including SMTP, Amazon SES, sendmail, or even direct mbox/maildir delivery.
* Multiple simultaneous configurations for more targeted delivery.

Mailer supports Python 2.6+ and 3.1+ and there are no other dependencies on external packages for normal operation [1].


h3(#goals). %1.1.% Goals

Marrow Mailer is all about making email delivery easy. Attempting to utilize the built-in MIME message generation classes can be painful, and interfacing with an SMTP server, or, worse, the command-line @sendmail@ command can make you lose your hair.  Mailer handles all of these tasks for you and more.

The most common cases for mail message creation (plain text, html, attachments, and html embeds) are handled by the @marrow.mailer.message.Message@ class. Using this class allows you to write clean, succinct code within your own applications.  If you want to use hand-generated MIME messages, or tackle Python's built-in MIME generation support for an advanced use-case, Mailer allows you to utilize the delivery mechanics without requiring the use of the @Message@ class.

Mailer is *not* an MTA like "Exim":http://www.exim.org/, "Postfix":http://www.postfix.org/, "sendmail":http://www.sendmail.com/sm/open_source/, or "qmail":http://www.qmail.org/. It is designed to deliver your messages to a real mail server ("smart host") or other back-end which then actually delivers the messages to the recipient's server. There are a number of true MTAs written in Python, however, including "Python's smtpd":http://docs.python.org/library/smtpd.html, "Twisted Mail":http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedMail, "pymta":http://www.schwarz.eu/opensource/projects/pymta/, "tmda-ofmipd":http://tmda.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/tmda/trunk/tmda/bin/tmda-ofmipd?revision=2194&view=markup, and "Lamson":http://lamsonproject.org/, but this is by no means an exhaustive list.



h2(#installation). %2.% Installation

Installing @marrow.mailer@ is easy, just execute the following in a terminal: [2]

<pre><code>pip install marrow.mailer</code></pre>

If you add @marrow.mailer@ to the @install_requires@ argument of the call to @setup()@ in your application's @setup.py@ file, @marrow.mailer@ will be automatically installed and made available when your own application is installed.  We recommend using "less than" version numbers to ensure there are no unintentional side-effects when updating.  Use @"marrow.mailer<4.1"@ to get all bugfixes for the current release, and @"marrow.mailer<5.0"@ to get bugfixes and feature updates, but ensure that large breaking changes are ignored.


h3(#install-dev). %2.1.% Development Version

Development takes place on "GitHub":github in the "marrow.tags":github-project project.  Issue tracking, documentation, and downloads are provided there.

Installing the current development version requires "Git":git, a distributes source code management system.  If you have Git, you can run the following to download and _link_ the development version into your Python runtime:

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/marrow/marrow.mailer.git
(cd marrow.mailer; python setup.py develop)</code></pre>

You can upgrade to the latest version at any time:

<pre><code>(cd marrow.mailer; git pull; python setup.py develop)</code></pre>

If you would like to make changes and contribute them back to the project, fork the GitHub project, make your changes, and submit a pull request.  This process is beyond the scope of this documentation; for more information, see "GitHub's documentation":github-help.

h2(#basic). %3.% Basic Usage

To use Marrow Mailer you instantiate a @marrow.mailer.Delivery@ object with the configuration, then pass @Message@ instances to the @Delivery@ instance.  This allows you to configure multiple delivery mechanisms and choose, within your code, how you want each message delivered.  The configuration is a dictionary of dot-notation keys and their values.  Each manager and transport has their own configuration keys.

Configuration keys may utilize a shared, common prefix, such as @mail.@.  By default no prefix is assumed.

<pre><code>from marrow.mailer import Delivery, Message

mailer = Delivery({...}, prefix=None)
mailer.start()

message = Message(...)
mailer.send(message)

mailer.stop()</code></pre>


h2(#managers). %4.% Delivery Managers

h3(#immediate-manager). %4.1.% Immediate Manager

The immediate manager attempts to deliver the message using your chosen transport immediately.  The request to deliver a message is blocking.  There is no configuration for this manager.


h3(#futures-manager). %4.2.% Futures Manager

Futures is a thread pool delivery manager based on the @concurrent.futures@ module introduced in "PEP 3148":http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3148/.  The use of @concurrent.futures@ and its default thread pool manager is that you can receive notification (via callback or blocking request) of successful delivery and errors.

When you enqueue a message for delivery a Future object is returned to you.  For information on what you can do with a Future object, see the "relevant section of the Futures PEP":http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3148/#future-objects.

h4(#futures-config). %4.2.1.% Configuration

The Futures manager understands the following configuration directives:

table(configuration).
|_. Directive |_. Default |_. Description |
| @workers@ | @1@ | The number of threads to spawn. |

The @workers@ configuration directive has the side effect of requiring one transport instance per worker, requiring up to @workers@ simultaneous connections.


h3(#dynamic-manager). %4.3.% Dynamic Manager

This manager dynamically scales the number of worker threads (and thus simultaneous transport connections) based on the current workload.  This is a port of the _TurboMail 3_ @ondemand@ manager to the Futures API.

fn1. In order to run the full test suite you need to install "pymta":http://www.schwarz.eu/opensource/projects/pymta/ and its dependencies.

fn2. If "Pip":http://www.pip-installer.org/ is not available for you, you can use @easy_install@ instead. We have much love for Pip and "Distribute":http://packages.python.org/distribute/, though.
